# Milestone 1 

Students today have to use two different calendars from different platforms. From Athena students get their weekly class schedule that tells them what times their classes are each day. However for any assignments or deadlines that teachers make, they have to reference the elc calendar which only shows deadlines. This is not very intuitive and may cause a student to forget an assignment’s due date or a class meeting. This is especially true for students returning to face to face class, where students have to actually commute to classrooms which greatly increases time commitments. Ostensibly there is a calendar program on elc, however, that one does not send alerts beyond emails (which must be opted in for) and is separate from the outlook calendar already synced with uga holidays and the athena class schedule. This means that students who have the foreknowledge of these tools must manually check their emails for deadline alerts, their class schedule or elc's calendar, Athena for class times, and outlook calendar for any school holidays or events they've manually added. 



From this many issues can arise. For example a student could decide that he wants to participate in an extracurricular club and needs to see if he can balance this with his course load. He checks his class schedule to see if the club's schedule has any conflicts with it, and sees none. However when he looks at elc's assignment calendar he thinks he has none assuming he work on certain assignments at different times but those new times conflict with his class schedule. Because these two calendars are separate he doesn’t realize this until it's too late. Even worse now, he has to juggle three different schedules to plan his week.

 

Face-to-face learning requires a much more disciplined and stricter organization of one's time. The difference between working on an assignment between two online lectures vs two in-person classes is night and day. Almost all of the time in between the two online lectures can be dedicated to completing the assignment, however with in-person lectures, one must find a place to work and commute from class A to that workplace and then to class b. This means that they have to set aside time in the day in order to accomplish work by certain deadlines. This overestimation of free time can be especially tough on students who started their college experience in the pandemic, they have no value of time in a face-to-face university when it comes to scheduling out their days.

 

The solution to the overarching problem of split calendars is to integrate Athena’s course schedule and elc’s calendar with outlook’s calendar that has UGA’s holidays. This way not only are all time commitments in one place for students to see, but they can make their own custom commitments (for studying, project work, etc) as well.

 

These issues affect all students including hybrid and fully remote, but are especially harmful to those who are transitioning to face to face class. Face to face learning requires the most discipline with scheduling as the commute to class makes the time where one can attend class more limited. Implementing this solution would help these students manage their time more efficiently which would help instructors and advisors as well. There would be less issues with registration and getting to class in a timely manner. Teachers would have less late assignments and late students and advisors would have less students withdrawing as well as less students changing their 4 year plan.
