**__Problem__**\
UGA students have to use at least two different calendars to get a general idea of what their daily, weekly, and monthly schedule looks for their academic courses. If they want to see what the deadlines are for different assignments and assessments they have to use elc. If they want to see what times their class meetings are at they have to use Athena’s class schedule. These calendars being separate yet equally important make it difficult for a student to at a glance get a visualization of their academic responsibilities for a week or day. This is something that is even more true with in person learning, as the commute to class makes time management much more important. No longer can you easily attend class while doing something else, now you have to get ready to commute to the classroom and stay there for the duration while away from your usual workspace. 

This means that all other activities outside of class, like the completion of work by certain deadlines, must be done outside of class meetings. This requires students to now exercise diligent time management. While it may seem intuitive that increased time management leads to deadlines being met and thus increased grades, there is extensive research done that supports this trend. Macan et. al. found that not only did students report a higher GPA when they had a higher perceived management of their time, but they also reported higher life satisfaction and lower stress.

Thus if students are unable to manage their time efficiently because they do not have a comprehensive schedule/calendar, their grades and mental health could suffer. 

This problem is unique in that it does not deal with one system that is lacking in affordances per se, but rather multiple systems that lack in scope. Each calendar has properties like columns and rows that afford organizing times by date AND hour. However the issue is that these systems exist independently with limited scope and are cumbersome for users to use at the same time.

**__Seven Stages of Action__**\
Goal-  See if a club’s meeting times match with your semester calendar/schedule

Execution:
- Plan-  Students think of different types of events they have such as class meetings ,assignment deadlines, UGA holidays, and think of the calendars each respective type is covered by.
- Specify-Check elc’s calendar, outlook’s calendar, your Athena’s class schedule, and your personal calendar if the times the meetings happen overlap with any commitments you have
- Perform- The student looks at the club calendar and cross checks each meeting’s time with ELC, outlook, Athena class schedule, and personal calendars in order to see any time conflicts. 

Evaluation:
- Perceive- Students would open up each calendar and see if there is overlap with any club meeting and any other time of event on any other calendar.   make a mental note o
- Interpret-The Student realizes that as far as he knows there is no overlap, but he is aware that what he's done was very time consuming and ineffective as he could have overlooked a conflicting event.
- Compare- The student understands that he really has no way of guaranteeing the accuracy of his conclusion without spending a significant amount of time and energy double checking. He has to assume that he accomplished his goal and hope he doesn’t have to repeat this lengthy process.
