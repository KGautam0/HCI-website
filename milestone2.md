**_Problem_**\
UGA students have to use at least two different calendars to get a general idea of what their daily, weekly, and monthly schedule looks for their academic courses. If they want to see what the deadlines are for different assignments and assessments they have to use elc. If they want to see what times their class meetings are at they have to use Athena’s class schedule. These calendars being separate yet equally important make it difficult for a student to at a glance get a visualization of their academic responsibilities for a week or day. This is something that is even more true with in person learning, as the commute to class makes time management much more important. No longer can you easily attend class while doing something else, now you have to get ready to commute to the classroom and stay there for the duration while away from your usual workspace. 

This means that all other activities outside of class, like the completion of work by certain deadlines, must be done outside of class meetings. This requires students to now exercise diligent time management. While it may seem intuitive that increased time management leads to deadlines being met and thus increased grades, there is extensive research done that supports this trend. Macan et. al. found that not only did students report a higher GPA when they had a higher perceived management of their time, but they also reported higher life satisfaction and lower stress.

Thus if students are unable to manage their time efficiently because they do not have a comprehensive schedule/calendar, their grades and mental health could suffer. 

This problem is unique in that it does not deal with one system that is lacking in affordances per se, but rather multiple systems that lack in scope. Each calendar has properties like columns and rows that afford organizing times by date AND hour. However the issue is that these systems exist independently with limited scope and are cumbersome for users to use at the same time. 


		
**_Seven Stages of Action_**\
Goal-  See if a club’s meeting times match with your semester calendar/schedule

Execution:
- Plan-  Students think of different types of events they have such as class meetings ,assignment deadlines, UGA holidays, and think of the calendars each respective type is covered by.
- Specify-Check elc’s calendar, outlook’s calendar, your Athena’s class schedule, and your personal calendar if the times the meetings happen overlap with any commitments you have
- Perform- The student looks at the club calendar and cross checks each meeting’s time with ELC, outlook, Athena class schedule, and personal calendars in order to see any time conflicts. 

Evaluation:
- Perceive- Students would open up each calendar and see if there is overlap with any club meeting and any other time of event on any other calendar.   make a mental note o
- Interpret-The Student realizes that as far as he knows there is no overlap, but he is aware that what he's done was very time consuming and ineffective as he could have overlooked a conflicting event.
- Compare- The student understands that he really has no way of guaranteeing the accuracy of his conclusion without spending a significant amount of time and energy double checking. He has to assume that he accomplished his goal and hope he doesn’t have to repeat this lengthy process.

**_Population Focus_**\
UGA Students 

**_Related Tasks_**\
Students all use ELC, Athena, and Outlook in conjunction with each other to view assignment deadlines, schedules, class location, uniform holidays, and etc. Students have to balance all three on a in order to complete daily tasks

**_User Benefit_**\
With this solution users will be better able to complete tasks on time or ahead of schedule, remove doubts regarding meeting location/time, and will decrease time spent on looking through the different calendars

**_Describe existing solutions_**<br>		
__Personal Calendar:__ <br>
An existing solution is that the student can simply create a personal calendar and consolidate all the important deadlines into their own personal platform. 

Examples: Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc. 

_Pros:_
- For each entry, the user has more control and can add more details that suit them. 
- For example, if a person would like to add an entry that reminds them that their math homework is due, they could add more details about the class or remove as much detail as they’d like. 
- Can add more events and create personal entries in addition to the academic information 
- The user can add reminders and other important dates, such as birthdays, into their personal calendar. The calendar is not limit to exclusively academic deadlines. 
Overall, the calendar can be more customizable to the user and applicable to more purposes 

_Cons:_
- There’s a higher chance of a user forgetting to manually input a deadline on the calendar, or even input inaccurate events/deadlines. The responsibilities of inputting the entries and deadlines fall onto the user, therefore it’s extremely easy for the user to not place a deadline and miss it. 

__Todoist:__ <br>
Another existing solution. The user can input a set of responsibilities and reminders. It gets sorted by the priority and deadline. 

_Pros:_ 
- It’s easier to see the most upcoming deadline and the priority of it. 

_Cons:_
- The same issue as the personal calendar as inputting the reminder falls onto the user, and it makes it easier for the user to miss a deadline or assignment if they forget to put it in. 


According to Hamilton, the author discusses how inefficient multitasking is. Researchers used an MRI scan to see the subject's brains as they completed multiple tasks. The study showed how “even simple tasks can overwhelm the brain when we try to do several at once.” This shows how having to use multiple platforms and calendars can be overwhelming for the user when having to know different details from different calendars.

**_Guidelines & Principles_** <br>
	
- According to Microsoft’s website, “Microsoft 365 apps are designed with the requirements of EN 301 549, WCAG 2.0 AA and US Section 508 in mind”. By following the Section 508 guideline microsoft outlook is safe and accessible to disabled individuals. 		 
- The ELC and outlook calendars have exceptional informative feedback. Once the user submits an event or task on the calendar it is instantly updated and easy to view. 
- Outlook has easy reversal of action abilities. When the user confirms task/event details, they can click the event and easily “delete” it or edit as they wish.
- The ELC, Athena, and Outlook all have similar properties and Strive for Consistency. They all have consistent colors, layouts, pages, and menus.

# C. <br>
## 1. <br>
**_Proposed Solution_** <br>
Integrate elc calendar and Athena Calendar with Outlook on UGA email address. This would mean that once a student has registered for classes and the semester has started they would be able to see all events from the Athena schedule and elc calendar on their outlook calendar respectively. This calendar would sync with ELC and Athena daily at midnight so that any changes in either would be shown in outlook. 

Integrating the two into outlook is ideal as outlook has more features and has a stronger application of good design principles like discoverability, feedback, and signifiers than ELC and Athena. Furthermore many UGA students use outlook or at the least office mail for their UGA email which means that they should be at least somewhat familiar with their app or even have it downloaded already this means there will be a steep learning curve, making the time to learn the system short.


**_Properties:_** <br>
Same current look. With a calendar interface, dates, time stamps, clickable events, description, view formats,except integrated between all the platforms, date bar. 

**_Affordances:_**<br>
- Dates and Time stamp interface affords identifying events by date and time of
occurrence. 

- Color coded events afford identifying event types at a glance.

- Written description affords remember what each event entails at a basic level.

- View formats afford managing time at differing scales, liek day-by-day, weekly or monthly.

- Date bar affords searching events by date.

**_Criteria to measure success_** <br>

Measuring success or failure of the solution will be quite explanatory since most data is quantitative. We are going to use a 2 step process to understand the success. First, a survey at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester asking students about their overall happiness with the system, if it improved productivity and time management, or if it was unpleasant. Secondly and most importantly, we will ask professors for quantitative data regarding tardiness, absence, and late or missed assignments for past semesters. With this data from both users and professors, we will be able to come to an accurate margin of success/error when contrasted with new post-solution data. Ideally late assignments, missing work, tardiness, and absences should decrease once the system is implemented.
